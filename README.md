Synopsis
Heart disease prediction system using machine learning:

Traditional heart disease diagnosis involves manual analysis, which is time-consuming,
error-prone, and costly. A machine learning-based prediction system automates data
analysis, enabling quick and accurate detection of risk factors.
This reduces reliance on manpower, minimizes paperwork, and optimizes resource
utilization. Early detection through such systems lowers long-term treatment costs and
improves healthcare efficiency.
